# User Registration Flowchart Documentation

## Overview
This document contains a comprehensive flowchart for the user registration process in the Airbnb clone project. The flowchart visualizes the complete data flow and decision points from initial form submission to successful account creation.

## Files Included
- `user-registration-flowchart.drawio` - Main Draw.io flowchart showing the user registration process
- `user-stories.md` - User stories derived from the use case diagram
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Flowchart Description

### Main Registration Flow
The flowchart illustrates a complete user registration process with the following key components:

#### 1. **User Input Phase**
- User fills out registration form with required fields
- Form includes email, password, personal information, and OAuth options
- Client-side validation occurs before form submission

#### 2. **Validation Layers**
- **Client-side Validation**: Email format, password strength, required fields
- **Server-side Validation**: Additional security checks, rate limiting
- **Database Validation**: Email uniqueness check

#### 3. **Account Creation Process**
- Password hashing using bcrypt/Argon2
- User record creation in database
- JWT token generation (access + refresh tokens)
- Welcome email sending via email service

#### 4. **Success Flow**
- Return success response with JWT tokens
- Store tokens in client (local storage/cookies)
- Redirect user to dashboard
- User is now logged in and ready to use the platform

### Alternative Flows

#### OAuth Registration
- Separate branch for Google/Facebook OAuth
- OAuth provider authorization flow
- User data retrieval and account creation/update

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios
- Network errors, server errors, database errors
- Email service failures and OAuth provider errors
- Proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Color Coding System

The flowchart uses a consistent color scheme to distinguish different types of operations:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Green (Start/End/Process)**: Main process steps, start/end points
- **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (Input/Output)**: User interactions and data storage
- **ðŸŸ£ Purple (Validation/OAuth)**: Validation steps and OAuth flows
- **ðŸ”´ Red (Decisions/Errors)**: Decision points and error handling
- **ðŸ”µ Blue (API)**: API requests and responses

## Key Decision Points

1. **Client Validation**: Does the form data pass client-side validation?
2. **Server Validation**: Does the data pass server-side validation?
3. **Email Exists**: Is the email address already registered?
4. **OAuth Option**: Did the user choose OAuth registration?

## Data Flow

The flowchart shows the transformation of data through the registration process:

1. **User Data** â†’ Form submission
2. **Validation Result** â†’ Client-side validation
3. **API Payload** â†’ Server request
4. **Hashed Password** â†’ Security processing
5. **User ID** â†’ Database record creation
6. **JWT Tokens** â†’ Authentication tokens

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/auth/register
```

### Request Payload
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
}
```

### Success Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe"
    },
    "tokens": {
      "accessToken": "jwt_access_token",
      "refreshToken": "jwt_refresh_token"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Responses
- **400 Bad Request**: Validation errors
- **409 Conflict**: Email already exists
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server/database errors

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt/Argon2
2. **Input Validation**: Multiple layers of validation (client + server)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
4. **JWT Security**: Secure token generation and storage
5. **Email Verification**: Welcome email sent for account confirmation

2. Implement email service integration
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement rate limiting

### Phase 3: Security & Optimization
1. Add additional security measures
2. Optimize database queries
3. Implement caching for performance
4. Add monitoring and logging
